Data Analysis:- 

Complex SQL queries aggregate data for generating reports and analytics within our web application. These queries often involve joins across multiple tables to fetch meaningful insights.Implemented advanced SQL querying strategies to analyze and optimize complex database queries.

Optimization:-

We optimize SQL queries by indexing frequently accessed columns and minimizing query complexity to enhance performance. I utilized CTE (Common Table Expressions) to optimize the queries.

Reverse Engineering:-

We use reverse engineering techniques to decipher undocumented legacy APIs, allowing our application to interact seamlessly with older systems without access to original documentation.Applied reverse engineering principles to deconstruct and enhance existing database schemas for better query performance.

Collaborated closely with database administrators and developers to implement optimized SQL solutions.

Technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL,SQL workbench.

Implemented indexing strategies that significantly improved database read/write operations.Received commendation from senior management for enhancing database performance and reducing operational costs.

I made a PPT for better understand of SQL Quries.
